Monte Carlo integration
--
1. Embarrassingly parallel problem;
2. To build an image use `docker build -t montecarlo .`;
3. To run it use `docker run montecarlo python3 run.py 10000000 5`, 
if you'd like to run simulation of 10000000 points on 5 CPUs;
4. Computation time will be calculated by completion.
